### A Star Algorithm

- $f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$
- $g(n)$: cost from start node to node $n$
- $h(n)$: heuristic function that estimates the cost from node $n$ to goal node
  - $h(n)$ should be admissible, meaning it should never overestimate the cost to reach the goal node, it can be an underestimate
  - $h(n)$ should be consistent, meaning for every node $n$ and every successor $n'$ of $n$ generated by any action $a$, the estimated cost of reaching the goal from $n$ is no greater than the step cost of getting to $n'$ plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from $n'$
    - $h(n) \leq c(n, a, n') + h(n')$
- $f(n)$: estimated total cost of path through node $n$ to goal node
